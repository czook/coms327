A straightforward dungeon generator that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathing of specific monsters and pseudo-random room and monster generation. Stairs are present which can be activated by invoking the matching symbol as the stairwell, '<' for up and '>' for down. Monsters are indexed and can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key. Source is structured between in C++ source files and parses definitions for template-able monsters and items from the $HOME/.rlg327 directory. Definitions can manipulate a range of traits and attributes in regards to the item and monster generation. Presently the source is modified to parse and print out the definitions and assigned values as per the specification provided in assignment 1.07 rather than operate the full game.
