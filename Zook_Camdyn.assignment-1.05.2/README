A straightforward dungeon generator that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathing of specific monsters and pseudo-random room and monster generation. Stairs are present which can be activated by invoking the matching symbol as the stairwell, '<' for up and '>' for down. Monsters are indexed and can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key menu which is scrollable should the list of monsters exceed the standard terminal size of 24 rows. NCurses is utilized as the means of creating an interactive an non-buffered-input user interface. NCurses induces a minor memory leak report by Valgrind, standardized at around 181,068 bytes with a slight increase if the 'm' menu is used, as it creates a new window, to around 206,249 bytes.
