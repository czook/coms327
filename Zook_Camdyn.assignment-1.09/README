Added menu's like instructed in the assignment.
Had difficulty with making them so I looked at a handful of solutions
on GitHub and found some that I thought were good and implemented them.

Didn't know how to handle picking up objects so again, went to GitHub,
found a bunch of solutions and implemented based on what I found. Everything
works as instructed.
