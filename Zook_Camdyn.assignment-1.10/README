In this assignment, we implemented ranged attacks. These can be initiated by utilizing the 's' command, and if you would like to make this automatic, you can utilize the 'a' command.Also, monsters can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key. Source is stored in C++ source files and can parse definitions for monsters in the $HOME/.rlg327 directory. 
In addition, colors are parsed for both monsters and objects.
