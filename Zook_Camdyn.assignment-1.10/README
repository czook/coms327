A straightforward dungeon generator that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathing of specific monsters and pseudo-random room and monster generation. Stairs are present which can be activated by invoking the matching symbol as the stairwell, '<' for up and '>' for down. Monsters are indexed and can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key. Source is structured between in C++ source files and parses definitions for template-able monsters and items from the $HOME/.rlg327 directory. Colors are parsed from the file for both monsters and objects which are then represented on-screen in a fabulous, colorful, manner. Ranged attacks are initiated through the 's' command and made automatic via the 'a' command. Ranged attacks operate on range and the cardinal directions with 'n' as the top of the screen.
