Got everything working for this project. Had several problems getting the menu to display properly but
it works except that it takes 2-3 ESC keys to fully exit the screen. Wasnt able to figure out why.

To create the menu:
-------------------
I itterated through the entire dungeon and got all of the monsters and stored their symbol and coordinates
in a monster_t struct i created. I then passed those monsters to a show_monsters function which also takes
in user input and handles scrolling up and down while using print_monsters to actually print the list. It
prints up to 12 monsters per page.

Stairs:
-------
created a new ter_stairs_up and ter_stairs_down. When the user uses the stairs he is teleported to a completely
new dungeon and cannot go back. There are only 1 stair per dungeon.
