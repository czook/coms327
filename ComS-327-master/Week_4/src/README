Usage: 
    ./dungeon
    ./dungeon --nummon <integer>

MAX <integer> is 30. If larger integer is in place, program will default to 30.
./dungeon
    - will spawn a dungeon with the PC at a random location and he'll drunkenly move around
./dungeon --nummon <integer>
    - will create monsters equal to the integer provided.
    - There will only be 1 Non tunnelling mob/room if integer > number of rooms
    - Non-Tunnelling monsters will run around randomly until they run into the PC
    - When the PC is hit by a monster, he'll die and you'll get a GAME OVER screen.

The professor said we will only be graded on tunnelling and nontunnelling. So there are only tunnelling and nontunnelling
monsters. For this submission, I was unable to get monsters to kill eachother,they can only kill the PC. There is also a 
bug with tunnelling monsters where sometimes when I render the dungeon parts of their corridors will dissapear. Not sure 
why. I took out the ability for tmobs to go up and this fixed most segfaults. Given everything that's happened with this 
weeks code, I'm pretty proud of this as it stands.
