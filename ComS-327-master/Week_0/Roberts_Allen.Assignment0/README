So I grabbed the professors pseudocode from Piazza and started writting it in C.
The idea is the same as the professors but to handle bookkeeping my idea is to create
a 2D array and when I "mark start as visited" I mark the location in the 2D array with
the number of that move. When I get to 25 moves then reset the counter, print the 2D array
and restart. 

The code prints a single line of 25 numbers, however, it does not print any correct solution 
and I'm not sure how to get this to run more than once. I looked over an algorithm I 
found online and it was very similar to the algorithm I wrote but had a few fixes that
I thought were really good so I implemented them on my own and still can't get it to work.

My thought process is that I'm not handling the recursion correctly the problem is that
I don't know how to fix it. I've tried several solutions and found some help online but
still can't get it working correctly. I believe I have most of the code there and that it's
good but I'm just missing a few key elements. On the bright side, my C environemnt setup
is excellent.
