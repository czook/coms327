Usage: ./rlg327

I created a parser.cpp which is an independent program from the rlg327 project.

I created a simple dice class which holds 3 integer values based on what dice
information is given in the monster description.

I created a monster class which holds all of the appropriate values the monster
needs as either a std::string, dice, or integer. 

My program, parser.cpp, pulls the file $HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt. It then
itterates through the given file and stores the desired values in my monster 
class then I put the monster information into a vector<monster> monster_list 
that I created. Once all of the monsters have beenread in, the program prints 
the monsters to the screen and exits.

My program handles the very basic error checking that was required. I did NOT
implement any further error checking, I'm under the impression that we don't 
have too.
