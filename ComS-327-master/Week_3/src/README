        2) The map for non-tunneling monsters
        3) The map for tunneling monsters

Use:
    'make'
    './dungeon'

First, I grabbed the professors code solution for 1.02. I then worked on
understanding how his dijkstra's algorithm implamentation worked and tried to
make my own version. I wasn't sure where exactly to start so I searched and 
read a bunch of solutions to this on GitHub. After understanding this better
from what I saw on GitHub I grabbed pieces from several different solutions
and put them together in my own way. Honestly, quite a bit of the dijkstra's
algorithm is copied from those solutions that I found. I am under the 
impression that this is fine as long as it isn't straight copy/paste, I used
the GitHub solutions to help understand how Dijkstra's worked and how to 
implament it in the dungeon.
