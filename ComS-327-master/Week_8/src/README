I added functionality to generate monsters based on their descriptions in
the monster_desc.txt file. I am currently generating all of the correctly 
written monsters in monster_desc.txt to the dungeon.

I was able to get monster colors working without too much issues. It displays
when the PC can see the monsters as well as if the player shows the entire 
map. 

I was not able to get descriptions working correctly. I'm having some weird
error with it that I'm not able to get past. I will continue to work on it 
tomorrow and hopefully get it finished before submission closes.
