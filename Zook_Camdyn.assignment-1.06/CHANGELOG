August 21, 2018 - Initialized CS327 Project

August 25, 2018 - Tested Atom, Vim, Emacs, VSCode, and CLion

August 26, 2018 - Decided on VSCode, though, Vim was a close second. Also set up version control with Git and GitHub.

August 28, 2018 4:00PM - Initialized Knights Tour with psudocode provided by instructor
August 28, 2018 4:30PM - Attempted to use an algorithm I found in a book to help with the knights Tour
August 28, 2018 4:45PM - Gave up on algorithms book version
August 28, 2018 5:30PM - Created a cool algorithm to find all the possible moves a knight can do
August 28, 2018 7:30PM - Trying to figure out how to finish the knights tour algorithm
August 28, 2018 10:00PM - Getting segementation faults and can't figure out why
August 28, 2018 11:00PM - Still getting seg faults and tired.

August 29, 2018 10:30AM - Realized my "cool algorithm" actually sucks, so got rid of that
August 29, 2018 4:30PM - Thinking I have a problem with recursion never ending, so trying to make a base case
August 29, 2018 5:00PM - No longer getting seg faults and printing a single line with 25 numbers, the numbers are wrong
August 29, 2018 6:00PM - Can't figure out anything, looking up algorithms online and found an algorithm that is VERY close so using that to help finish
August 29, 2018 9:00PM - SO, I tried for several hours to get this damn thing to work but nothing seems to help and I don't know what I'm doing wrong
August 29, 2018 10:00PM - Wrote my Makefile, CHANGELOG, and README and calling it. I'm not sure what to do from here
August 29, 2018 9:30PM - Created base directory for all assignments
August 29, 2018 9:45PM - Initialized DungeonGenerator project and added high level TODO

September 2, 2018 9:00PM - Started creating pseudocode for project

September 3. 2018 7:00PM - Starting code of project
September 3, 2018 7:30PM - 80x21 wall created correctly 
September 3, 2018 8:15PM - Created int fetchRand(int N) which creates a random number between 0 and N

September 4, 2018 4:00PM - Worked on figuring out an algorithm for creating the rooms

September 5, 2018 4:00PM - Started working on Room generation
September 5, 2018 6:45PM - Creating random sized and located rooms correctly, now need to add them to the Dungeon
September 5, 2018 7:30PM - Trying to put the dungeon starting x,y position in the dungeon but it's not working correctly
September 5, 2018 7:45PM - Okay, fixed bug, now it's creating the coordinates correctly WITHOUT collision detection. Next step is to print the boxes without colDetection.
September 5, 2018 8:15PM - Rooms are created randomly in the dungeon without collision detection
September 5, 2018 9:00PM - Rooms are goooood, refactored code a bit to make it better
September 5, 2018 9:15PM - Crappy colDetection for rooms made, kinda works, working on the corradors now
September 5, 2018 9:30PM - collision kind of works. It can be super hard on the computer though. it's pretty crappy in all honestly
September 5, 2018 10:00PM - Couldn't get the hallways made, calling it so this assignment isn't late.

September 7, 2018 10:00PM - Grabbed professors dungeon generator code

September 9, 2018 6:00PM - Started reading and learning how professors code works
September 9, 2018 8:00PM - Started save_load.c to learn how to use binary files

September 10, 2018 5:00PM - Writing piece by piece different parts of a binary file by hand and evaluating it in hexdump
September 10, 2018 9:00PM - Have most of the binary file saving properly.

September 11, 2018 7:00PM - Started working on the load functionality
September 12, 2018 3:00AM - Loading now works perfectly with in save_load

September 12, 2018 5:00PM - Started writing code to test all of the professors dungeons in save_load.c
September 12, 2018 5:30PM - Save load is perfect... on to implementing it in professors code.
September 12, 2018 11:00PM - accidently deleted my changelog, going to get the program working then update this.
September 12, 2018 11:00PM - everything works except difference between corrador and halls.
September 12, 2018 11:55PM - Finally works!!!
September 12, 2018 12:15PM - finally figured out big endian stuffz. hope this works perfectly and i get a 10/10

September 20, 2018 12:00PM - Grabbed professors solution for 1.02
September 20, 2018 5:30PM - met with a TA to help get a better grade on 1.02

September 25, 2018 6:00PM - Started assignment 1.03
September 25, 2018 6:30PM - Reformatted professors code because it looks like crappy
September 25, 2018 8:00PM - Can't figure out how Dijkstra's works, so looking at other GitHub solutions
September 25, 2018 11:00PM - Tried to be smart and break up the professors code into .c and .h files and have a main.c run everything... Didnt work at all
September 26, 2018 1:00AM - I understand Dijkstra's better, also wrote some base code to work with that does a basic print of 3 dungeons
September 26, 2018 2:00AM - Copied some code from GitHub to see if it even works and better understand how it works
September 26, 2018 2:30AM - Figured out how it works better, Have tunneling mobs version working, however it has a bug, I think it doesn't display correctly
September 26, 2018 3:30AM - Got non-tunneling map working. Believe it's 100% correct.
September 26, 2018 3:45AM - Pushed everything to GitHub and updating README/CHANGELOG
September 26, 2018 4:00AM - Running with Valgrind to make sure I handle memory correctly.
September 26, 2018 4:00AM part 2 - No memleaks! Also had to install valgrind on ubuntu. 
September 26, 2018 4:00AM part 3 - Actually upon further inspection, I believe this works perfectly.
September 26, 2018 4:00AM part 4 - Turning it in!

October 1, 2018 7:00PM - Got professors code and started by making PC move around.
October 1, 2018 9:00PM - PC moves around randomly

October 2, 2018 6:00PM - Started making Non-tunneling monsters and making them move around.
October 2, 2018 9:00PM - NTMobs move around perfectly.

October 3, 2018 5:00PM - forgot about --nummon. so started that.
October 3, 2018 7:00PM - Nummon works but only makes 1 NTmob/room and T mobs don't move around.
October 3, 2018 8:00PM - Trying to fix bug with Tmobs not moving around/causing segfaults.
October 3, 2018 9:00PM - Turning off tmobs mvmnt for now and turning in cause Ntmobs work fine.
October 3, 2018 11:55PM - Got it glitchily working. Turning in final.

October 15, 2018 10:00PM - Got professors code and started

October 16, 2018 11:30PM - Added stairs correctly

October 17, 2018 1:00AM - Everything works except menu
October 17, 2018 7:30 PM - Menu finally printing but segfaults and doesnt show everything
October 17, 2018 9:30PM - Menu works but requires user to press ESC 2 or 3 times to actually exit the menu, Not sure why.
October 17, 2018 10:00PM - Turning in.

October 20, 2018 10:00PM - Grabbed professors code

October 23, 2018 6:00PM - Started porting to C++
October 23, 2018 7:00PM - Everything ported to C++ and working as intended. Starting to make characters classes.
October 23, 2018 8:00PM - Character, NPC, PC are classes and working correctly.
October 23, 2018 11:00PM - Been working on trying to get teleportation working but keep failing, not entirely sure why

October 24, 2018 9:00PM - Finally got teleport working correctly. Everything except PC line of site works perfectly.
October 24, 2018 9:00PM - Turning in this copy because I need more time and dont want to get penalized just in case TA's decide to close submission early.

October 25, 2018 12:00AM - Finished and working perfectly without any error's and/or memleaks!
