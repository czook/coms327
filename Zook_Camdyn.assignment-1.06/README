 I ported everything from C to C++ and turned Character into a Class. I also
 turned NPC and PC into classes that inherit from Character. My biggest issue
 with porting was correcting the errors but I was able to fix the errors within
 a couple of hours.

 I implemented a teleportation function so that when the player pressed 'g'
 they were put into teleportation mode until they pressed 'g' again which 
 exits normally or press 'r' which places them in a random position in the 
 dungeon then exits. 

 I was able to add the PC fog of war. Basically I made a char map and anything
 the PC saw was added to the map and the map was what was rendered instead of
 the normal dungeon. Seems to work flawlessly. It currently remembers monsters
 however the monsters are shown several times if the monster chases the PC.
 I don't think this is an issue though.
